# landingPage
This repository is for the temporary construction and deployment of a GitHub Page that will act as a 'landing page' for commmunity vape until administrative/domain managment and other services are integrated. 

## Scope
The single card landing page purpose is to display the business logo, social media links, location and business hours

### Design Concept
- Ideally a gradient color background fitting with the Black, Red, and Gold of the business' logo. 
- The Left hand side of the page will have a large display of the Logo itself. 
- The right hand side will have 3 social media links:
  - Facebook
  - Instagram
  - Google Reviews
- Under the Social Buttons will be a hyperlinked address (to google maps location)
- After that list the business hours

### Usage
After the above is displayed, administrative services will point DNS records towards this page as the domain is queried. 
- After which I will also explore adding the custom domain to the github page feature.. may not though
